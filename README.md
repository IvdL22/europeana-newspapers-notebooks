# Jupyter notebooks for Europeana newspaper text resource processing
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/clarin-eric/europeana-newspapers-notebooks/main?labpath=start.ipynb)

These notebooks have been designed to help getting started with the processing historical text resources (from [Europeana Newspapers](https://www.europeana.eu/en/collections/topic/18-newspapers))
with natural language processing (NLP) tools (from [CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu)) using [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

The easiest way to get started is to click the `Launch binder` badge above. This will guide you through the process of creating your own Jupyer instance in which you can interactively discover ways of accessing and querying metadata, analysing text resources within notebooks, and using advanced NLP tools on your own selection of newspaper texts.

For more information, you can also have a look at [start.ipynb](start.ipynb) right here.
